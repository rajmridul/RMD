# Deployment Update

## Issue Fixed
The original deployment was failing due to an outdated MediaPipe dependency version. The error was:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe==0.8.10 (from versions: 0.10.5, 0.10.7, 0.10.8, 0.10.9, 0.10.10, 0.10.11, 0.10.13, 0.10.14, 0.10.15, 0.10.18, 0.10.20, 0.10.21)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe==0.8.10
```

## Changes Made
1. Updated the requirements.txt file to use MediaPipe 0.10.5 (the earliest available version) instead of the unavailable 0.8.10 version.
2. Added compatibility notes in the posture_analysis.py file.
3. Created a test script (test_mediapipe_version.py) to verify the new MediaPipe version works correctly.
4. Added a verification script (verify_deployment.sh) to test the deployment.

## If Issues Persist
If you encounter issues with the updated MediaPipe version:

1. Check the MediaPipe API changes between 0.8.10 and 0.10.5, especially regarding the Pose detector parameters.
2. Run the test script to verify MediaPipe is working correctly.
3. Look for any warning messages in the application logs that might indicate API compatibility issues.

## MediaPipe API Changes
MediaPipe 0.10.x may have changes in the API compared to 0.8.x. The key parts to check are:
- Pose detector initialization parameters
- Landmark access methods
- Drawing utilities

If specific errors occur, consult the [MediaPipe documentation](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) for the appropriate version.
